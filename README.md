# Multidisciplinary AIoT Project #
## Introduction ##

This project aims to develop a system that utilizes the RS485 interface with soil, air, and camera sensors to read the farm conditions and using a NUC as a host server to process the raw data. The system applies AI to give out decisions for the plants and allows control through the Adafruit Dashboard and Android mobile app.

## Methodology ##
1. The soil, air, and camera sensors are connected to the RS485 interface, which then communicates with the NUC host server.
2. The host server processes the raw data from the sensors and applies AI algorithms to make decisions for the plants.
3. The decisions are then published on the Adafruit Dashboard and Android mobile app, allowing users to remotely control the system.

The soil and air sensors are used to measure various factors such as temperature, humidity, and moisture levels. These sensors are connected to the RS485 interface and transmit data to the host server, which is a NUC (Next Unit of Computing) computer. The NUC processes the raw data and applies artificial intelligence algorithms to make decisions about the optimal conditions for the plants.
The system also includes an Adafruit Dashboard, which is used to monitor and control the various sensors and actuators in the system. The Adafruit Dashboard allows the user to view real-time data from the sensors and to make adjustments to the system as needed.

In addition to the Adafruit Dashboard, the system also includes an Android mobile app that allows the user to remotely access and control the system from a smartphone or tablet. The mobile app provides the same functionality as the Adafruit Dashboard, but is more convenient for users who are on the go.
